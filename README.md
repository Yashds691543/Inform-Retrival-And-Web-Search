# Inform-Retrival-And-Web-Search
The project demonstrates computational techniques for searching information within both static document collections and dynamic web environments.

Text Processing Algorithms: Implementations of various algorithms for effective text processing.
Classical Information Retrieval Models: Examples of Boolean and Vectorial models for information retrieval.
Web Search Techniques: Techniques tailored for searching and retrieving information from dynamic web collections.
This project is closely related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and builds on concepts from both fields to provide comprehensive solutions for efficient and accurate information retrieval.

# STEPS:

1) Websearch
2) Preprocessing
3) final
4) Inform Retrival
