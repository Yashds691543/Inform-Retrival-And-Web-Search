Web Search & Word Frequency Analyzer
This project implements a basic web search and word frequency analyzer. It fetches HTML content from a specified website, extracts links, retrieves the text, and processes it to calculate word frequencies. The project is particularly useful for analyzing the distribution of words across different web pages.

Features
Link extraction: Extracts all links from the provided webpage.
Web scraping: Retrieves the textual content from each link and processes it.
Word frequency analysis: Outputs a sorted list of words with their frequencies.
How it works
HTML Parsing: The script uses BeautifulSoup to parse HTML content from a given webpage.
Link Gathering: It collects all valid hyperlinks on the page.
Text Extraction: For each link, it retrieves the web page's text content.
Word Frequency Calculation: It identifies and counts occurrences of each word in the text, ignoring case.


I'll review the notebook file and help you create a suitable README for your GitHub repository. Let me take a look at the content first.

The notebook you've provided appears to be focused on a web scraping project that retrieves and analyzes content from a specific website, particularly focused on gathering words, counting their frequency, and extracting links from the HTML structure. Here's a draft of the README.md for your GitHub repository:
